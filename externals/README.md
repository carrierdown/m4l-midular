Midular externals
=================

This directory contains JavaScript-based externals that are used by some of the modules. Please note that you do not need to download these in order for the Max-patches to run, since they are baked in to the patches themselves. However, if you're interested in knowing more about these externals and my approach to writing them, please have a look at this blog post about [doing test-driven development in Max/JavaScript-land](http://upland.no/tdd-cycling74-max-javascript/).
